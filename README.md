# PFCH-Crime-in-the-City
My code for my PFCH final
To get the data used in my report all you need to use is the CrimeCategories.JSON and the Final Data Get try 2.py
To use the FindingCrimeTypes.py file you must have a previous version of the NYPD Arrest Data (Year to Date) and is only used to learn the different crime types that are in the data and manually create CrimeCategories.JSON
